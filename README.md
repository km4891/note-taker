  ## Description

   For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed. AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes. I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.
